            <h3>why choose us?</h3>
            <p>Because we are making the process of travel planning easier for their clients and ensure they experience the best trip possible. Travel agents work directly with the public and converse with clients in order to determine the best possible travel destinations, transportation arrangements, and accommodations for the client's particular needs.
            </p>
            <p>Travel agents may make suggestions to the client based on their experience, or offer complete travel packages from various resorts or cruise lines. They need to be able to offer their clients travel arrangements that suit both their financial limitations and leisure or business travel expectations.

                    <p>Pretty happy with the service we received on this booking. Kristy provided good communications and a great deal. I'd recommend booking with Travel Online as it's just so much easier than trying to arrange everything yourself, plus we got such an awesome deal. I'd love to see more full board offers from Travel Online in the future. Or at least an option when booking hotels, as it's probably not for everyone.</p>

                    <p>We have just returned from a Thailand Holiday booked through Travel Online. The holiday was perfect and everything went according to schedule as booked. We were a little apprehensive because after booking and prior to departure there was little to no contact from Travel Online, despite my phone calls and emails. However, it all went smoothly our flights, transfers and accomodation was exactly as we expected. I would not hesitate to book another holiday through Travel Online, but maybe a little more reassuring contact would be appreciated prior to departure.</p>

                    <p>My wife & I have been using travel on line for many years with out complaint. We are unsure how your
business is structured but never seem to get the same person twice its always a different consultant each time.
Three years ago prior to covid lock down we did one of our regular trips to Phuket we steered an extra 17 people to use you on that trip. Sadly we did not receive any acknowledgement or appreciation from travel on line. Being in sales my self. acknowledgement and appreciation of repeat business was a critical part of sales.
( just saying ) other than that we where happy & the trip was successful with out incidents and we shall continue to use travel on line.

                    <p>The deal was value for money. All the information and vouchers were provided well ahead my travel date. Would have given 5 star if the communication was better. It took while for Travel Online to get back to me with my queries.</p>

                    <p>After the years we have had, booking a holiday was what we needed.
But the team at travel on line was great with every question I had, I was stressed as my husband name was wrong, but again Tammy reassured me it will be ok and it was.
Since our 1st holiday with travel online I have not booked another company,
Why would you when your get great service here.
Our next holiday I will be looking out for Thailand specials.
Thank you</p>
